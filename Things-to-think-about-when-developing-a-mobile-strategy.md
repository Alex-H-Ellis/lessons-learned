# There are many things to think about when developing a mobile strategy.

**First of all - do you even need to develop a mobile strategy? In today's day and age, the answer to this question is almost definitely "Yes!"**

Even if most of your users are not visiting through their mobile devices, you should still optimize your site for mobile because at least SOME of your users will come through that way and more will undoubtedly come in the future.

**Assuming that developing a mobile app does make the most sense, the next logical step is to ask - what platform or platforms should you support? Why?**

The answer to this question depends on the situation but, generally, you want to reach as many of your users as possible so making an app availbale on all platofrms (or as many as you can) is best.

**Once you've reached this step, you must decide how to build the app - how should you go about this?**

Developing a native app from the get go is almost never a good idea. This is for a few reasons, including (1) you likely have no idea which features are the most important to your mobile users, (2) you will have to develop native apps for each platform, and (3) it can be very, very expensive and potentially all for naught.

Using a development tool like [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com) or [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/) will at least get you started and will help you understand what features to eventually keep, add or exclude from your native apps in the future. The maxim here is: "Don't code when you don't need to."

 // Note: if you are a major corporation, with the budget and a great understanding of your product and customers, then native first may make sense.
