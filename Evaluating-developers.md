The goal of this branch is to list out factors that can help any individual without a programming background to evaluate developers.
First, pay is a solid rule of thumb
Second, which languages they work with and understanding why they prefer these languages
Third, do they use any frameworks and if they don't what is the reason
Fourth, the ability to understand what is required to test the commercial viability of a product or software and prioritize writing different pieces of the software accordingly
The below link is an interesting perspective from what we learned in class with the input of of developers instead of business students with an important overlap with the takeaways that we learned in class: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2103114/evaluating-developers
