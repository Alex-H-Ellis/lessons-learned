#The goal of this branch is to list out factors that can help any individual without a programming background to evaluate developers.#
###First, pay is a solid rule of thumb generally speaking the more money a developer is asking, the higher the chances that he/she will be a good developer and provide quality work
**Second, which languages they work with and understanding why they prefer these languages**
*Third, do they use any frameworks and if they don't what is the reason*
Fourth, the ability to understand what is required to test the commercial viability of a product or software and prioritize writing different pieces of the software accordingly
The following [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2103114/evaluating-developers) is an interesting perspective from what we learned in class with the input of of developers instead of business students with an important overlap with the takeaways that we learned in class.
