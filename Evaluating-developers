First, pay is a solid rule of thumb
Second, which languages they work with and understanding why they prefer these languages
Third, do they use any frameworks and if they don't what is the reason
Fourth, the ability to understand what is required to test the commercial viability of a product or software and prioritize writing different pieces of the software accordingly
